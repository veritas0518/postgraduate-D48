# postgraduate-D48
Today is another normal day of review. Recently, I finally started the review of Java. I used to use C language because of the course, and now I can learn what I like. Just now I thought that when I first started the postgraduate entrance examination, I wanted to apply for the major of automatic control, so I felt that I was so naive at that time, and others could not continue to study my own major, Interdisciplinary to apply for computer professional, I am the opposite of others, that kind of professional out to find a job? I think there are only three majors in the world, one is computer major, the other is finance major and other majors.
